N3C Data Governance and Compliance Workflow
Multi-Phase Security & Compliance Protocol
Institutional and Individual Agreements
Site Contributions
Researcher Contributions
Institutional Data Use Agreement (DUA)
Individual: Signs Data Access Request (DAR)
Establishes the permitted uses of the Data by the signing institution as assured by the signatory Institution
Personal Investigators (PI): Follow Controlled Access Data Repository (CADR) Protocols
Data Transfer Agreement (DTA)
Sites sign DTA and submit a standard payload
Risk:
Control Mechanism:

Parallel accountability structure ensures that both sites (institutional agreements) and researchers (individual and PI commitments) formally commit to ethical and legal compliance prior to data access request advancement.

NIH Data Access Committee
Institutions review every Data Access Request within a 30-day window.
Final Formal Review
If sites do not approve within 30-day window, site is included in study.
Risk:
Excluded codes may still be included via research loopholes

Final Formal Review
NIH DAC reviews research intent
Risk:
Sites may miss review window
Control:
Default inclusion after 30 days ensures research continuity
Risk:
Control Mechanism:
If researchers do not fully declare all research intent in phenotype and relevant codes, excluded patient codes are at risk of being included in studies through subgroup analysis.
While sites share data based on their agreed upon tier structure (A, B, or C), researchers define their phenotypes and declare question-relevant codes to be used in analysis. These parallel streams converge at the DAR Review Committee where Subject Matter Experts assess proposals and provide feedback to researchers.
Researchers Submit Data Use Request
DURs are time-limited (1 year) and renewable (twice). Phenotypes may be reused across studies.
A secure workspace is provisioned with approved data, including linked external datasets. Access is restricted to authorized team members.
Secure Research Enclave
Analysis occurs within a FedRAMP-authorized enclave. ISAs enable access to HPC environments for advanced analytics.
Risk:
Control Mechanism:
Malicious actors may copy row level data or export datasets without DAC approval. This behavior is a direct violation of the previous agreements which are monitored and audited to take action in the event of a violation.
Approved researchers access data exclusively within a highly controlled, continuously audited environment. Direct data export is prohibited without final publication committee approval.
Download Request
Researchers apply to download data that complies with download policy.
Risk:
Control Mechanism:
If policy is not followed, row level, non-aggregate data could be removed from enclave.
DAC reviews and approves request to ensure compliance.
